# Describing Class Types
:idprefix: classes_

If you have a `struct`

```
struct X
{
    int m1;
    int m2;
};
```

use the `BOOST_DESCRIBE_STRUCT` macro to describe it:

```
BOOST_DESCRIBE_STRUCT(X, (), (m1, m2))
```

`BOOST_DESCRIBE_STRUCT` is defined in `<boost/describe/class.hpp>` and should
be placed in the same namespace as the `struct`.

It takes three arguments: the `struct` name, a list of base classes
(empty in our example), and a list of (public) members by name (this includes
both data members and member functions.)

To describe a class type with protected or private members, use the
`BOOST_DESCRIBE_CLASS` macro instead, placing it _inside the class_.

```
class Y: private X
{
public:

    int m3;

protected:

    int m4;

private:

    int m5;

public:

    int f() const;

private:

    BOOST_DESCRIBE_CLASS(Y, (X), (m3, f), (m4), (m5))
};
```

It takes three member lists, for the public, protected, and private members.

Once a type `T` is annotated, its properties can be retrieved via
`describe_bases<T, M>` and `describe_members<T, M>` (`M` is a bitmask of
modifiers such as `mod_public | mod_static | mod_function`).

These primitives are defined in namespace `boost::describe`, in the headers
`<boost/describe/bases.hpp>` and `<boost/describe/members.hpp>`, respectively.

`describe_bases` takes the following possible modifiers: `mod_public`,
`mod_protected`, `mod_private`, or a bitwise-or combination of them. The
presence of `mod_public` includes the public bases in the result, its absence
excludes them. The other two modifiers work similarly.

(At least in principle. The current implementation cannot distinguish between
protected and private base classes, so protected bases are returned as private.
Consequently, using `mod_protected` gives no result. Lifting this limitation
would require compiler support.)

`describe_members` takes a bitwise-or combination of the following possible
modifiers: `mod_public`, `mod_protected`, `mod_private`, `mod_static`,
`mod_function`, `mod_inherited`, `mod_hidden`.

The access modifiers work the same as with `describe_bases` (except here
`mod_protected` actually works when `BOOST_DESCRIBE_CLASS` is used.)

(For types annotated with `BOOST_DESCRIBE_STRUCT`, the protected and private
member lists will be empty.)

When `mod_static` is present, the static members are returned, otherwise
the nonstatic members are returned.

When `mod_function` is present, the member functions are returned, otherwise
the data members are returned.

When `mod_inherited` is present, members of base classes are also returned.

When `mod_hidden` is present, hidden inherited members are included. A member
of a base class is hidden when a derived class has a member of the same name.

For the above class `Y`, `describe_bases<Y, mod_any_access>` will return a
type list `L<D1>` containing a single base descriptor `D1` describing `X`:

```
struct D1
{
    using type = X;
    static constexpr unsigned modifiers = mod_private;
};
```

`describe_members<Y, mod_private>` will return a type list `L<D2>` containing
the descriptor of the data member `Y::m5`:

```
struct D2
{
    static constexpr int Y::* pointer = &Y::m5;
    static constexpr char const * name = "m5";
    static constexpr unsigned modifiers = mod_private;
};
```
